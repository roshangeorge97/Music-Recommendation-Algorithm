# Music Recommendation System

This project is a Music Recommendation System that uses the Spotify Dataset to suggest songs to users based on their listening history and preferences. The system uses machine learning algorithms to analyze user data and recommend songs that match their taste.

## Dataset

The Spotify Dataset used in this project contains information on songs and their features such as tempo, key, loudness, and danceability. It also includes user data such as listening history and playlists.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need to have the following:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Spotipy

## Usage

To use this Music Recommendation System, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `music_recommendation_system.ipynb`

3. Run the notebook cells to perform EDA and train the machine learning model.

4. Input your Spotify username and password when prompted.

5. Input the name of a song or artist that you like.

6. The system will recommend songs that match your taste based on the data analysis and machine learning model.
